Integration HUB for E-Filing

## Development

Prerequisites: Docker

To get up and running developing, build the docker image:
```bash
$ setup.sh
```

Once setup has finished you can run docker container with:
```bash
$ dev.sh
```

This will run the container in the foreground with STDIN open and place you into root/karaf.
